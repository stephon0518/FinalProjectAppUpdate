I've lost the ability to make a draft of a regular post, the audio editing for reels is incredibly unreliable so I've have to scrap many once I've adjusted it more than once, and my messages just don't appear. I use the app to sign up for art shows in certain chats, and the spaces are gone by the time I'm able to see the new messages a day or two later (I get a partial preview on my screen at first). I'd love a non glitching, intuitive version!
It was great. Now it's a poor knock off of tic toc. Easy solution is to separate videos from images, allowing people to decide what they want to interact with. The ads are also getting obnoxious, and show up every four to five posts. The best part of the app is how it organizes images in your profile. I'm a big fan of that. They removed the search filters for new post, which means you can only look up popular post now. Very disappointing, and seems to force you to only look at what's popular.
It's alright, just updated the app so will see how that goes seeing as everyone is having issues with the reels. My biggest issue still is having to delete one notification at a time. You would think for such big platform like this there would be an option (or easier way than they have already) to delete multiple notifications at once. Hopefully I'm the future this will be a feature added!! ðŸ‘Œ
