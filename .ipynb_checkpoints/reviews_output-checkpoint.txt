I've lost the ability to make a draft of a regular post, the audio editing for reels is incredibly unreliable so I've have to scrap many once I've adjusted it more than once, and my messages just don't appear. I use the app to sign up for art shows in certain chats, and the spaces are gone by the time I'm able to see the new messages a day or two later (I get a partial preview on my screen at first). I'd love a non glitching, intuitive version!
It was great. Now it's a poor knock off of tic toc. Easy solution is to separate videos from images, allowing people to decide what they want to interact with. The ads are also getting obnoxious, and show up every four to five posts. The best part of the app is how it organizes images in your profile. I'm a big fan of that. They removed the search filters for new post, which means you can only look up popular post now. Very disappointing, and seems to force you to only look at what's popular.
It's alright, just updated the app so will see how that goes seeing as everyone is having issues with the reels. My biggest issue still is having to delete one notification at a time. You would think for such big platform like this there would be an option (or easier way than they have already) to delete multiple notifications at once. Hopefully I'm the future this will be a feature added!! ðŸ‘Œ
Very frustrating lately. Most issues seem to be with audio. When creating a reel, after choosing the music and adjusting it just right and saving in drafts, and then it's gone! When I open the reel in drafts, the music is gone. I have to go back and add the music again. And then, often times it still posts without the music!! You can see the song title on the reel, but there is no audio!! It's becoming not worth the time or effort. Hope things get fixed before I feel a need to give up!
For being a PICUTRE/VIDEO app, you think it'd let you resize your photos. If I have a photo that obviously needs to be in square format, why would you not have an option to fit the ENTIRE image in the square while maintaining scaling? It's so simple. On top of that, there's almost no point of saving drafts. Because when you go back to the same draft, it's corrupted 99% of the time and you have to start all over. Pretty ridiculous.
The app used to work perfectly fine, but for the past month or two it's been freezing when I open it, rendering it completely unusable. Actually, if I don't touch the screen, everything works. If I click on different tabs (Explore page, profile, etc), I can see posts and watch videos. The moment I try to scroll is when it crashes lol. I've tried updating, uninstalling and re-downloading it, turning my phone off and on again, deleting other apps, clearing caches, but I still can't use the app.
